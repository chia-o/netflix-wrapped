<H1>A project that creates a Spotify Wrapped dupe for my Netflix viewing history from 2012 - 2025 üçø.</H1> 

<h2>I wrote the app in Python and used a Postgres backend to store the viewing data. Using the OMDB API to fetch genres for the titles, I added genres to my titles, and then read a JSON file to create a general Genres table. Finally, I wanted to visualize my queries, so I created a React frontend.</h2> 


Queries:

- What was my most streamed title of all time?
- Most streamed movie?
- Most streamed show?
- How many minutes I‚Äôve spent all time streaming titles?
- What were my top 5 most streamed titles?
- What day I watched the most titles? And what title was it?
- Did I watch more titles by tv, phone, or laptop?
- Usual time of day I watched titles (night, morning, afternoon)
- What was my most watched genre?
- What were my top 5 genres?
